# Flight Planner

## Summary

This is a pet project to try and mimick sites such as SkyScanner and Goolgle flights. I plan to apply what I learnt in a Coursera course on graph algorithms. The program will read data from a mock graph and be able to calculated the routes with the shortest distance, cheapest route and least stops.

## Roadmap

I first plan to build the logic, making a flight planner class. Once that is working through my command line I'll build a back end using Flask and host it on Heroku.
